# DNA-to-Protein-sequence
Translate a string containing a nucleotide sequence(DNA) into a string containing the corresponding sequence of amino acids.

DNA_to_Prot.py  :  source code written in Python that is responsible for converting given nucleotide sequence (DNA) to a sequence of                          corresponding Amino Acids.

DNA.txt         :  contains example DNA sequence which was used for testing.(New DNA (nucleotide) sequence should be stored in this file                      by overwriting previous data)

Protiens.txt    :  contains sequence of amino acids which is the correct sequence for DNA sequence(DNA.txt) which was used for testing. 
                   (New amino acid sequence should be stored in this file by overwriting previous data).
